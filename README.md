Interface MySQL with PLC via Node-RED
====

## About repository
In this repository you will find various examples of Reading and writing information between **Node-RED and MySQL** 

> This respository is part of **Interface MySQL with PLC via Node-RED Course** published at âœ…
> https://codeandcompile.com/course/interface-mysql-with-plc-via-node-red

## What you can do with this repository?
 -  Learn various ways to send data (standalone, array, objects) to various charts
 -    Read data directly from MySQL and show it on the Node-RED Chart

## How to use this repository with PLC
 - Read the controller (PLC or Arduino) using Serial or MODBUS TCP/IP communication.
 -  Replace the simulated data with your PLC or Arduino data

## Examples:

### Reading Single value
In this example, you can read the single variable with timestamp from MySQL and show it on the chart as shown below:

In the above example, the values are coming from the table defined in the MySQL database.


### Reading two values
In this example, you can read the single variable with timestamp from MySQL and show it on the chart as shown below:

In the above example, the values are coming from the table defined in the MySQL database.

### Reading more than two values:
The code can be modified easily to read more than two values stored in the MySQL table

### MySQL Table
The following is the format of MySQL table used for the example. The schema is included in the repository and can be used for testing.

 - **timestamp1**: This is used for storing the datetime in 'String' format. 
 -  **timestamp2**: This is used for storing the datetime in ISO format which helps to display values on the Chart easily.
  - **value1**: Dummy value for showing it on the chart
  - **value2**: Dummy value for showing it on the chart

Note: value1 and value2 are simulated in the project using random flow, the user can take the values from PLC or any other controller.
